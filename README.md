# Alisym Keyboard
* An Alice layout keyboard, focused on symmetry and handwiring. *
This keyboard was inspired by the Cheshire keyboard by will23f, and is a modified version of that keyboard. I had a chance to build the cheshire but without a PCB, the handwired process was a little finicky, so i wanted to make more space for a microcontroller and redesign the layout to my liking.
This led me to a keyboard with more space on the bottom to handwiring, a hard split backspace, hard split right shift and a modified bottom row. This makes it a pseudo-symmetrical Alice WKL.
